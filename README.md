## Data Structure
The filenames on that page are Cayenne device name (32 randomish characters) followed by the Cayenne channel number. Perhaps I should change that to be human readable!
Please try this:
'Mouse over' a filename to see the Cayenne channel number on the right: image.png
Click on a file name to download all the data for a channel.  This can be downloaded or copied and pasted into a spreadsheet.
Click on a date and time and you can look at all the data uploaded over the hour leading up to that time.
